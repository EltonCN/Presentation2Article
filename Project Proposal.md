# Final project proposal

**Project title:** Text2Article

**Project abstract:** The project idea is to generate a informative article draft about the seminar 06, "Talking to Machines: A Practical introduction to Generative AI". The project input will be annotations about the seminar, sumarizations of the studies  selected in the literature review activity, and the intended audience. The output will be the article text, divided in sections. For each section layout information will be created, like sentences to highlight and terms to define in auxiliary text boxes. Images will also be proposed for each section (descriptions only, without the real image). The final output will be exported in LaTex format.

**AI tools to be used:** [Llama3 LLM](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/), accessed using the [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/) via Python code.
