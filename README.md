# Presentation2Article

The project idea is to use a LLM to generate a informative article draft about the seminar ["Talking to Machines: A Practical introduction to Generative AI"](https://feec-seminar-comp-eng.github.io/seminars/seminars-1-2024/6/), by Gabriela Surita, part of 1S/2024 graduate seminar class ["IA382"](https://feec-seminar-comp-eng.github.io/) from Unicamp. The project input is the annotations about the seminar, the intended audience and the seminar transcription. The output is the article text draft for subsequent review and editorial treatment, divided in sections. For each section layout information is created, like sentences to highlight and terms to define in auxiliary text boxes. Images will also are proposed for each section (descriptions only, without the real image).
